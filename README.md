## Notes

1. The biggest challenge was Implementing the "Users can customize the interface" feature. despite AI's help, I was having a hard time implementing the feature. My goal was to add 3 things: 
    1.1 Feed Density
    Compact View: Show only title, author, and upvotes (current default)
    Comfortable View: Add slightly more padding and spacing between posts
    Expanded View: Show full content, images, and media previews directly in the feed

    1.2 Post Card Layout
    Card vs List: Toggle between card-based layout and list-based layout
    Grid vs Stack: Show posts in a grid (2-3 columns) or vertical stack
    Thumbnail Position: Move media thumbnails to left, right, top, or hide them

    1.3 Change color modes:
    Users can toggle between color modes (not light or dark mode but different color combos including default(the current one))

adding different color modes was the easy part but the other 2 I could not figure out and because of time constraints, I could not work on it any longer so I had to abandon this stretch feature for now. I will add this in the future however. (Any suggestions on how i can approach this are welcome)

2. the secopnd challenge was implementing the psuedo authentication. i somehow managed to implement it by manual ID entering, as in user sets a secret key and that key is used to allow the "Admin" to delete posts. The user is assignex a dummy ID. However, it is only for show

3. The reposting feature also gave me a hard time because I cpuldnt figure out how to thread the discussion. Earlier on, it reposted but did nothing. however now reposting shows the parent post in details page and users can comment on the reposted post as well.
